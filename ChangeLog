	* src/tasks/task-bison.scm (arc:bison-keywords): added verbose?
	parameter

2003-04-24    <gck@eyestep.org>

	* bumbed version to 0.4.0; release
	
	* rebuild the dependency subsystems.  Implemented a simple API
	which now all tasks, supporting dependency control should use.
	Dependencies are stored now in a single database file (a hashtable
	actually), and are referenced by full path name.  Fixed name
	clashs here therefore

	* added a hash implementation from slib

	* added supported for "rpath" and local execution of
	applications linked to not installed shared libraries

	* added full freebsd support

	* extended cygwin support, but "local-exec-outdir:" is missing yet
	
	* added first real exotic tasks (task-orange-compile,
	task-orange-deps), as a prove of concept, that extending beyond
	the scope of standard tools is feasible.

	* documentation
	
	* fixed numberous bugs

2003-04-18    <gck@eyestep.org>

	* the system is now ready for a new release ... 0.3.0 i guess.  a
	lot have changed radically.  only to mention a few things: 

	* 'real' oop introduced, this makes extensibility easier and more
	transparent

	* rebuild the system interface layer by using oop.  adding new
	systems can now happen much more transparent than before.  Even
	adding new scheme interpreter support is easier, i hope

	* redesigned the task engine, tasks now implement the 'business
	logic' (dependencies, etc.), whereas the real work is done
	normally by backend classes.  These backend classes are system
	dependend and are loaded on demand from declaration files located
	in src/meta-inf.  Since oop's inheritance scheme, one can write
	generic task backends, which are used by multiple platforms.

	* redesigned the Arcfile syntax.  Arcfile's are now interpreted by
	a meta-scheme interpreter -- so they don't run in a different
	scope, than arc itself, and code from Arcfiles can't clash with
	arc or	destroy or even misuse arc internals.  Furthermore
	Arcfiles are much more readible and less 'schemish' (=lowlevel).

	* added first beginnings of the arcconfig subsystem.

	* added a simple exception (try/throw) subsystem, to make the arc
	system more robust in future
	
	* added a number of default tasks: task-bison, task-flex,
	task-version, first beginning of task-cvs.  Extended an fixed a
	number of more tasks.  Especially rewritten most of the task-lib
	stuff.  Shared libraries are now fully compatible with linux ELF
	system's versioning scheme.

	* added ports to BeOS and FreeBSD

	* added regexp support

	
2002-08-12    <gck@eyestep.org>

	* extended documentation

	* added arc:filter, arc:dist, ... tasks

	* added Asc, the Arc Scheme interpreter and build support scripts
	for it

	* configure (Configuration): completely rewritten the
	configuration and bootstrapping system.
