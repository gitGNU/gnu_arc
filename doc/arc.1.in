.SH NAME
arc \- the fully extensible, open and scriptable build tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arc
[
.B options
]
.I statement
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Arc
is a utility to maintain source trees of programs.  It is used to build
programs, libraries, documentations, and maintain dependecies of 
source files.  \fIArc\fP is used to process \fBArcfiles\fP.

.I Arc
is a complete replacement for the make utility, but offers large
scripting possibilities and is platform transparent.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.BI \-C " dir"
Change to directory \fIdir\fP before reading a build script or doing
anything else.  The 'current working directory' is moved to \fIdir\fP,
so that configuration files, etc. are located in the given directory,
not in the current working directory, from where arc has been called.
.TP 5
.BI \-f " file"
Load \fIfile\fP as build script instead of utilizing the normal search
for a build file.  If the option \fI-r\fP is specified, too, search's for
this file recursively upwards the directory hierachy.
.TP 5
.B \-r
By default arc searchs for a build script only in the current working
directory.  If the \fI-r\fP options is specified it tries to search for a
build script recursively upwards from the current working directory and
uses the first found.
.TP 5
.B \-k
Continue as much as possible after an error; continue if statement failed
.TP 5
.BI \-o " os"
Assumes the operating system \fIos\fP during evaluation.  \fIOS\fP is set by default to
the symbolic name of the current machine but using this switch one can
force the selection of targets with special \fIos:\fP properties
.TP 5
.B \-i
Show information about the callable statements in the script to be loaded
and exit
.TP 5
.B \-v
Be verbose.
.TP 5
.B \-h
Print an informative help message describing the options and then exit.
.TP 5
.B \-V
Print the version number of Arc on the standard error output and then exit.
